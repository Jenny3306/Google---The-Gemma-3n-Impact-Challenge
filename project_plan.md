# Project Plan: Talk2TextVN

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To build an offline Vietnamese Speech-to-Text app aimed at improving accessibility for:
- Older adults who find it hard to use keyboards.
- People with hearing impairments who benefit from real-time speech conversion.
- Users who are unfamiliar with typing and prefer voice-based interactions.

## ðŸ“… Day-by-Day Plan

### **Day 1: Setup and MVP Definition**
- **MVP Features**: Define the core features:
  - Simple UI with a button to start recording and a text box to display the output.
  - Whisper for speech recognition.
  - Offline functionality, requiring no internet.

### **Day 2: UI and Speech Integration**
- Develop a basic Streamlit UI.
- Integrate Whisper for Vietnamese speech-to-text functionality.
- Test and refine the application with various speech inputs.

### **Day 3: Post-Processing and Enhancements**
- Implement text formatting (line breaks, punctuation).
- Test and ensure smooth operation offline.

### **Day 4: Gemma 3n Integration**
- Integrate Gemma 3n via Ollama for text enhancement (summarizing or beautifying the output).
- Ensure seamless communication between Whisper and Gemma 3n.

### **Day 5: Demo Video and Documentation**
- Record a demo video showcasing the app in action.
- Begin preparing a technical writeup for submission.

### **Day 6: Final Refinements**
- Polish the user interface and ensure stability.
- Final testing of the app.

### **Day 7: Write-up and GitHub Repository**
- Complete the technical documentation and README.
- Upload the final code to GitHub.

### **Day 8: Project Live Page**
- Set up a live page for project showcasing (Notion, GitHub, etc.).
- Ensure accessibility for the judges.

### **Day 9: Final Checks and Submission**
- Verify the code, test app, format the write-up, and submit the project.

## ðŸ§© Challenges & Considerations
- **Whisper Model**: While Whisper is good for Vietnamese speech recognition, it might need optimization for more accurate transcription.
- **Offline Functionality**: Ensure that the app runs efficiently without the internet, which might pose challenges with resource management.

## ðŸ”‘ Success Metrics
- **User Experience**: A seamless, intuitive app that works well for the three target audiences.
- **Offline Performance**: The app should work without internet, ensuring privacy for users.
- **Recognition Accuracy**: High accuracy in converting speech to text, especially for Vietnamese.

## ðŸ“… Final Submission Deadline
- **Deadline**: August 6, 2025.
